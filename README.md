# Shelter Animals
Machine Learning project that attempts to predict a shelter animal's outcome given information about it. More specifically, we are using data from Austin's animal center from Oct 2013 -> Mar 2016 that give the status of dogs and cats as they leave the animal shelter. 
<br>
Possible outcomes for the animals include: *Adoption, Death, Euthanasia, Returned to owner, and transfer to a different facility*.
Features present in the data include: *Breed, Fur color, Spayed vs. Intact, Gender, and Age upon exit of the shelter*.

Please view the **Report.pdf** for a full explanation of scope, data, methods, and results.
