# Shelter Animals
This is a machine learning project that attempts to predict a shelter animal's outcome given information about it. A Kaggle dataset composed of entries from an Austin, Texas based animal shelter from the years Oct 2013 to Mar 2016 are used as input data for the predictive models.

Please view the **Report.pdf** for a full explanation of scope, data, methods, and results.  

**Models Explored**: *Naive Bayes, Multinomial Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Multilayer Perceptron*.  
**Animal Outcomes**: *Adoption* , *Death, Euthanasia, Returned to owner, and transfer to a different facility*.  
**Features present**: *Breed, Fur color, Spayed vs. Intact, Gender, and Age upon exit of the shelter*.
