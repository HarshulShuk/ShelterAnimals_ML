# Shelter Animals
<p>Machine Learning project that attempts to predict a shelter animal's outcome given information about it. More specifically, we are using data from Austin's animal center from Oct 2013 -> Mar 2016 that give the status of dogs and cats as they leave the animal shelter.</p> 

<p>Possible outcomes for animals: *Adoption, Death, Euthanasia, Returned to owner, and transfer to a different facility*.
Features present: *Breed, Fur color, Spayed vs. Intact, Gender, and Age upon exit of the shelter*.
Models explored:*Naive Bayes, Multinomial Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Multilayer Perceptron *.</p>
